# Quadrotor

The objective of this design project is to design and develop a control law for a drone such that it passes through an obstacle course of rings in the shortest amount of time. In order to achieve this objective, the techniques of a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) were employed. 

The repository contains all necessary files, including the URDF for the drone. To view the simulation, run the Jupyter notebook titled 'GenerateResults.pdf'. 

The findings of this simulation can be found in the report included in this repository.
